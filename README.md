This is my very first webpage, created as a part of The Odin Project's Web Development curriculum. 

First, I put together the HTML. I didn't know where to start, but putting the basics down (Doctype, html, head, and body) made it somehow easier to start. This was fairly straightforward, just putting elements on the page. Man did it look bad! Something interesting I found was that a Nav Bar (the way that W3 schools described it) is structured as a list, which I did not think of at first but that makes total sense. 

Then came the styling. I never really appreciated CSS until now; it really turned this page from something that looked ridiculous into something that looked like Google! For whatever reason, I always imagined HTML or JS does all the work and CSS was a 'helper', but this preconceived idea was completely wrong. 

Something I really appreciated was that every CSS question I had was answered, either on a doc page or Stack Overflow. It is finnicky and some of it stressed me out (for example, why was my bottom nav bar ever so slightly shifted right?), but this formatting is so extremely powerful. 

I would love to pair-program with someone on CSS in the future because, while the internet had some great tips and tricks, some of them felt sort of hacky. While this page is functional, I would love to go over it once more and figure out what I could change to conform to best practices.

Web Dev has always been a very intimidating subject for me, so I am very excited that I figured this out! The Odin Project has a great curriculum and W3 documentation was extremely helpful.
